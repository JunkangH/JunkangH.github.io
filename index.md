I am currently a third year master student as the physics department of Fudan University in China. I am interested in the mathematical structures of field theories, string theories, etc. I am working on topics including:

1. Aspects of supersymmetric field theories.
2. Superconformal indices and their usages in testing dualities and correspondences.
3. Generalized symmetries.

## Notes

I like to write notes, and I have always been trying to present knowledges as "natural" as possible. In particular, I cannot bear with unnatural logic order between chapters.
